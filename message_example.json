A charming personality is the key to an effective negotiation. \nLet us understand how one’s personality traits help in an effective negotiation. \n\nDuring negotiations an individual must try to be himself. One should not fake things or pretend to be good. If you are not satisfied with the deal, do not pretend that you are happy. It’s better to raise a concern then and there, rather than crib later. Be normal and relax, things will automatically fall into place. \n It’s important to be sincere rather than just being serious. Sincerity is one of the most important personality traits required in negotiation. One has to be sincere for an effective negotiation. Don’t take things casually. Go well prepared for your negotiation. For a business deal, try to study everything related to the deal beforehand. The agenda of the negotiation must be very clear to you. Carry all the related documents which you might require at the time of negotiation. Don’t go just for the sake of it. \nBe honest. Don’t fake things. During negotiations, honesty plays an important role. One should never manipulate his salary to get a hike in the next organization. Don’t speak unnecessary lies just for some money.",
